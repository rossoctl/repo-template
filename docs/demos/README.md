# Demos — guided walkthroughs

Hands-on tours you **drive by hand**, one command at a time, explaining as you go. Each one
shows something a conventional setup cannot do, and is structured in _acts_ so it survives
being performed live in front of an audience.

## What lives here

| Demo                                 | Shows                                  | Time    |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------- |
| [`<name>-demo.md`](<name>-demo.md)   | <the claim, in one line>               | ~10 min |

<!-- One row per demo. The "Shows" cell is the claim, not the topic: a reader decides from
     this table alone whether this is the demo they want. -->

## Demo vs. smoke test vs. spec

These three overlap and are easy to confuse:

- **A demo (here)** is _performed_. It optimizes for a human explaining a claim out loud, so
  it narrates why each step matters and deliberately pauses on the moments that are hard to
  believe. Every command is copy-pasteable.
- **A smoke test** is _asserted_. It optimizes for an unattended pass/fail with no narration.
  Most demos here should have a scripted sibling. Prefer the script when you want a pass/fail;
  prefer the demo when you want to _convince someone_.
- **A spec or ADR** ([`../specs/`](../specs/), [`../adrs/`](../adrs/)) records the _**why**_ —
  the decision and its rejected alternatives. A demo shows the _what_, and goes stale when the
  commands change; a decision record does not.

A **runbook** — "how to stand this up in environment X" — is a demo's close cousin. If it is
meant to be read while typing, it belongs here; if it is a reference you consult rather than
perform, it belongs in [`../notes/`](../notes/).

## Conventions

If you add a demo, follow the shape of the existing ones:

- **Open with the claim**, then a table of "what the normal thing needs / what this needs". A
  reader should know in fifteen seconds whether this demo is the one they want.
- **Acts, with lettered sub-steps** (`### 1a.`, `### 1b.`) so you can resume mid-performance
  and so a reviewer can cite a step.
- **Blockquote callouts (`>`) for the narration** — what to _say_, and which traps the step
  defends against. Keep them out of the code blocks so the commands stay copy-pasteable.
- **Show expected output** inline. A demo whose output you cannot compare against is a demo
  that has silently rotted.
- **State the prerequisites once, up front** — cluster, credentials, env vars — with the
  command that verifies each. A demo that fails in act 3 for a missing variable wastes the
  room's attention.
- **End with "What just happened"** (recap the claims, numbered) and **"Cleanup"** (leave the
  environment as you found it — restore any env you flipped _first_).
- **Be honest about limits.** A closing "Notes and limits" section naming what the demo does
  _not_ show is worth more than an extra act, because it is what stops someone
  over-promising in a room.
